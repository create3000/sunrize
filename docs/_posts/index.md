## Introduction

Sunrize is an easy-to-use editor for X3D files that is based on the [X_ITE](https://create3000.github.io/x_ite/) framework. The Outline Editor allows for intuitive scene editing, while the Script Editor provides comprehensive editing of Script nodes and ComposedShader nodes.

## Usage

Because Sunrize is a Node program it can be run without installing it using NPM's **npx** command:

```console
$ npx sunrize [files]
```

>**Note:** The first time, it may take a while for Sunrize to start.
