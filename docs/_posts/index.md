## Run from Console

First you need to install both Node.js and npm on your system. To accomplish this, you can use a Node installer from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>.

Then you can run Sunrize without installing it using npm's **npx** command:

```console
$ npx sunrize@latest [files]
```

>**Note:** The first time, it may take a while for Sunrize to start.
