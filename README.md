## Introduction

Sunrize is based on [X_ITE](https://create3000.github.io/x_ite/) and is a basic editor for X3D files. The scene can be edited in an Outline Editor and there is a Script Editor where Script nodes and ComposedShader nodes can be edited.

## Usage

First you need to install both Node.js and npm on your system. To accomplish this, you can use a [Node installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Windows), or use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install node (macos), or use your Linux package manager.

Then you can run Sunrize without installing it using npm's **npx** command:

```console
$ npx sunrize@latest [files]
```

>**Note:** The first time, it may take a while for Sunrize to start.
